# User Management System

This User Management System is a web application that provides user registration and login functionality. It utilizes Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the hemant, while the backend is built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. React Query and Context API are employed for state management in the hemant.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can sign up for an account by providing their email and password.

- **User Login:** Registered users can log in using their credentials.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**

  - Next.js: React framework for building efficient web applications.
  - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.

- **State Management:**

  - React Query: Library for managing and caching asynchronous data in React.
  - Context API: React's built-in state management solution.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
  - Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data.
